Quick definition

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a pattern that combines a retriever (which finds relevant documents from a corpus) with a generative model (an LLM) that composes an answer using those retrieved documents as grounding. In short: instead of asking the LLM to answer from its internal memory alone, you give it relevant external context first — this improves accuracy, recall of domain facts, and reduces hallucinations.

Why use RAG? (benefits)

Access to up-to-date or private data (docs, product manuals, company knowledge) without fine-tuning the model.

Better factuality — the model’s output is grounded in retrieved documents.

Smaller models can perform like bigger ones for domain tasks because they get external context.

Easier data governance — you control the corpus and can attach metadata/citations.

Core components (what you need)

Document store / corpus — your knowledge base (PDFs, web pages, DB records).

Chunking/Text splitter — break long docs into retrievable pieces (chunks).

Embeddings model — converts text chunks and queries into vectors.

Vector index / store — FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc. (stores vectors & metadata).

Retriever — nearest-neighbour search (dense vectors) or sparse search (BM25), or hybrid.

Reranker (optional) — cross-encoder that reorders retrieved candidates for higher relevance.

Generator (LLM) — the LLM that conditions on retrieved context and the user query to produce the final answer.

Prompt template / grounding strategy — how you feed retrieved docs to the LLM safely and effectively.

Business logic — thresholds, caching, pagination, audit logs, citations.

End-to-end pipeline (step-by-step)

Prepare documents

Collect docs and split text into appropriate chunk sizes (e.g., 200–800 tokens — depends on model/context window).

Keep metadata: source id, filename, page, URL, date.

Embed & index

Create embeddings for each chunk and index them into your vector store.

Query time

Receive user query → create embedding for query.

Retrieve top_k chunks (k commonly 3–10) by nearest neighbour search.

Optional rerank

Use a cross-encoder reranker to reorder retrieved chunks for higher precision.

Construct prompt

Build a prompt that contains:

Short instruction to the LLM (task + constraints).

The retrieved documents (or their summaries/excerpts).

The user’s question.

Example instruction: “Answer using the documents below. If the answer isn’t in the documents, say ‘I don’t know’. Quote the source id for each claim.”

Generate

Send prompt to the LLM and return the generated response (optionally include citations).

Post-processing

Apply business rules: redact PII, attach citations, confidence scoring, save logs, etc.

Simple conceptual prompt pattern
You are an assistant that answers using the documents below.
If the documents do not contain the answer, say "I don't know."

Documents:
[1] Doc title — excerpt or chunk text...
[2] Doc title — excerpt ...

Question: {user_query}

Answer concisely and cite the documents using [1], [2], ...

Implementation sketch (Python-style pseudocode)
# 1. Indexing (one time)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
vectors = embed_model.embed_documents([c.text for c in chunks])
vector_store.add(vectors, metadata=[c.meta for c in chunks])

# 2. Query time
q_vec = embed_model.embed_query(user_query)
candidates = vector_store.similarity_search_vector(q_vec, top_k=5)
# optional: rerank with cross_encoder
prompt = build_prompt(candidates, user_query)
answer = llm.generate(prompt)
return answer_with_citations(answer, candidates)


(Replace with your stack: OpenAI/Hugging Face embeddings, FAISS/Pinecone/Weaviate, LangChain/Haystack wrappers if desired.)

Common architectural variants

RAG-Sequence vs RAG-Token (original Facebook RAG): differ in how retrieved documents are integrated during generation (sequence-level fusion vs token-level).

Late fusion / Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD): pass multiple documents to the decoder which attends to all of them — strong for long contexts.

Hybrid retriever: combine BM25 (sparse) + dense vectors for recall and precision.

Reranker added: use a lightweight retriever then rerank with a heavier cross-encoder.

Best practices & practical tips

Chunk size matters — too small loses context; too big wastes vector space and may exceed prompt limits. Aim for 200–800 tokens typically.

Top_k tuning — start with 3–5; increase if answers miss context. Use score thresholds to avoid low-relevance docs.

Include metadata — store source id, URL, date so you can cite.

Prompt with explicit instruction to cite — ask the model to quote source ids.

"Don't guess" guardrail — instruct LLM to reply "I don't know" when evidence is insufficient.

Reranking helps — cross-encoders greatly improve precision for QA tasks.

Cache popular queries — reduces cost & latency.

Monitor retrieval quality — measure precision@k and check for hallucinations.

Privacy & safety — filter PII before indexing, and control what content is allowed in responses.

Common pitfalls & how to avoid them

Hallucinations despite retrieval — usually due to poor prompt or irrelevant docs. Use strict grounding instructions and reranker.

Out-of-date index — implement incremental reindexing for frequently changing data.

Over-reliance on retrieved chunk text — if the chunks contain ambiguous statements, the generator may produce wrong conclusions. Prefer clear, authoritative source texts or preprocess summaries.

High cost/latency — retrieving many docs and calling an expensive LLM can be slow/expensive. Use smaller LLMs for draft answers and escalate only when needed.

When to use RAG

You have a private or changing knowledge base (company docs, product catalogs, legal docs).

The model’s training cutoff lacks needed facts.

You want transparent answers with source citations.

You want to avoid expensive fine-tuning for every domain change.

When not to use RAG: tiny simple FAQ where static retrieval is enough, or when you need verified answers from authoritative live systems (e.g., bank balances) — there you should call the authoritative API directly and not rely on document retrieval.

Evaluation & monitoring

Automatic metrics: precision@k for retrieval, BLEU/ROUGE for generation (when ground truth exists), retrieval recall.

Human eval: factual correctness, helpfulness, faithfulness.

Production monitoring: track queries that return low-scoring docs, user corrections, and "I don't know" occurrences. Log sources used for each answer.

Example real-world use cases

Customer support: answer from product manuals.

Internal knowledge base assistant for employees.

Legal / compliance search plus summarization.

Personalized tutoring built over course materials.

Quick checklist before you build

Decide the corpus and how often it updates.

Pick an embedding model (quality vs cost tradeoff).

Pick a vector store (FAISS for local, Pinecone/Weaviate for managed).

Choose the LLM (response quality vs cost), and design the prompt template.

Implement logging/citations so answers are auditable.

If you want, I can now:

Give a concrete code example for your stack (OpenAI embeddings + FAISS + OpenAI chat) — runnable.

Draft a prompt template tuned for your domain.

Sketch a small architecture diagram and recommended parameter defaults (chunk size, top_k, reranker).
